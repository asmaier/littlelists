2005  | [Rebhan: Theoretische Physik II](ww.amazon.de/Quantenmechanik-Relativistische-Quantenfeldtheorie-Elementarteilchentheorie-Thermodynamik/dp/3827402476/?tag=maierandi-21) | Second book of Rebhans amazingly compact series. The only book which doesn't use natural units for QFT.
2000  | [Pauli: Electrodynamics: Volume 1 of Pauli Lectures on Physics](https://www.amazon.de/Electrodynamics-Pauli-Lectures-Physics-Vol/dp/0486414574/?tag=maierandi-21) | The Pauli lectures are the insider tip! They are very short and concise, but simply masterful and full of gems.  
      | [Pauli: Optics and the Theory of Electrons: Volume 2 of Pauli Lectures](https://www.amazon.de/Optics-Theory-Electrons-Lectures-Physics/dp/0486414582/?tag=maierandi-21) | My favorite book of the Pauli lectures. Every sentence is full of deep wisdom. 
      | [Pauli: Thermodynamics and the Kinetic Theory of Gases: Volume 3 of Pauli Lectures](https://www.amazon.de/Thermodynamics-Kinetic-Theory-Gases-Lectures/dp/0486414612/?tag=maierandi-21) | "No quantity with the dimension of time appears in thermodynamics" writes Pauli. With sentences like this Pauli again shows his deep understanding of the subject.
      | [Pauli: Statistical Mechanics: Volume 4 of Pauli Lectures](https://www.amazon.de/Statistical-Mechanics-Pauli-Lectures-Physics/dp/0486414604/?tag=maierandi-21) | Did I mention that the Pauli lecture books are also very cheap (< 10 Euro per book)? There is no reason to not buy them all. 
      | [Pauli: Wave Mechanics: Volume 5 of Pauli Lectures](https://www.amazon.de/Wave-Mechanics-Pauli-Lectures-Physics/dp/0486414620/?tag=maierandi-21) | Pauli's extremly consize approach to quantum mechanics shows, that he is a complete master of the subject. 
      | [Pauli: Selected Topics in Field Quantization: Volume 6 of Pauli Lectures](https://www.amazon.de/Selected-Topics-Field-Quantization-Lectures/dp/0486414590/) | This book shows, that Pauli gave lectures on path integrals even before Feynman did. A historical gem.  
1999  | [Rebhan: Theoretische Physik I](https://www.amazon.de/Theoretische-Elektrodynamik-Allgemeine-RelativitÃ¤tstheorie-Kosmologie/dp/3827402468/?tag=maierandi-21) | Rebhan manages to put the whole curriculum of theoretical physics into two books. This is the first book of the series.
