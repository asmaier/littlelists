------|-------|------
2014  | [Stöcker: Taschenbuch der Physik](https://www.amazon.de/Taschenbuch-Physik-Horst-Stöcker/dp/3808556757/?tag=maierandi-21) | The "Bronstein" of physics
2010  | [Feynman: Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals](https://www.amazon.de/Dover-Books-Physics-Mechanics-Integrals/dp/0486477223/?tag=maierandi-21) | Path integrals explained by their inventor - Important reference
2007  | [Yourgrau: Variational Principles in Dynamics an Quantum Theory](https://www.amazon.de/Variational-Principles-Dynamics-Quantum-Physics/dp/0486458881/?tag=maierandi-21) | Rare book showing how to develop hydrodynamics from a variational principle
2005  | [Brown: Feynman's Thesis](https://www.amazon.de/Feynmans-Thesis-Approach-Quantum-Theory/dp/9812563660/) | Many ideas of Feynman published later are explained in more detail in his thesis - A historical gem
2005  | [Rebhan: Theoretische Physik II](ww.amazon.de/Quantenmechanik-Relativistische-Quantenfeldtheorie-Elementarteilchentheorie-Thermodynamik/dp/3827402476/?tag=maierandi-21) | Second book of Rebhans amazingly compact series. The only book which doesn't use natural units for QFT.
2002  | [Feynman: Lectures on Gravitation](https://www.amazon.de/Feynman-Lectures-Gravitation-Frontiers-Physics/dp/0813340381/?tag=maierandi-21) | The most advanced book by Feynman on quantum theory of gravitation - a gem not widely known
2000  | [Pauli: Relativitätstheorie](ww.amazon.de/Relativitätstheorie-Domenico-Giulini/dp/3642635482/?tag=maierandi-21) | The book that made Pauli famous and was praised by Einstein
2000  | [Pauli: Electrodynamics: Volume 1 of Pauli Lectures on Physics](https://www.amazon.de/Electrodynamics-Pauli-Lectures-Physics-Vol/dp/0486414574/?tag=maierandi-21) | The Pauli lectures are the insider tip! They are very short and concise, but simply masterful and full of gems.  
      | [Pauli: Optics and the Theory of Electrons: Volume 2 of Pauli Lectures](https://www.amazon.de/Optics-Theory-Electrons-Lectures-Physics/dp/0486414582/?tag=maierandi-21) | My favorite book of the Pauli lectures. Every sentence is full of deep wisdom. 
      | [Pauli: Thermodynamics and the Kinetic Theory of Gases: Volume 3 of Pauli Lectures](https://www.amazon.de/Thermodynamics-Kinetic-Theory-Gases-Lectures/dp/0486414612/?tag=maierandi-21) | "No quantity with the dimension of time appears in thermodynamics" writes Pauli. With sentences like this Pauli again shows his deep understanding of the subject.
      | [Pauli: Statistical Mechanics: Volume 4 of Pauli Lectures](https://www.amazon.de/Statistical-Mechanics-Pauli-Lectures-Physics/dp/0486414604/?tag=maierandi-21) | Did I mention that the Pauli lecture books are also very cheap (< 10 Euro per book)? There is no reason to not buy them all. 
      | [Pauli: Wave Mechanics: Volume 5 of Pauli Lectures](https://www.amazon.de/Wave-Mechanics-Pauli-Lectures-Physics/dp/0486414620/?tag=maierandi-21) | Pauli's extremly consize approach to quantum mechanics shows, that he is a complete master of the subject. 
      | [Pauli: Selected Topics in Field Quantization: Volume 6 of Pauli Lectures](https://www.amazon.de/Selected-Topics-Field-Quantization-Lectures/dp/0486414590/) | This book shows, that Pauli gave lectures on path integrals even before Feynman did. A historical gem.  
1999  | [Rebhan: Theoretische Physik I](https://www.amazon.de/Theoretische-Elektrodynamik-Allgemeine-Relativitätstheorie-Kosmologie/dp/3827402468/?tag=maierandi-21) | Rebhan manages to put the whole curriculum of theoretical physics into two books. This is the first book of the series.
1996  | [Frisch: Turbulence](https://www.amazon.de/Turbulence-Legacy-N-Kolmogorov/dp/0521457130/?tag=maierandi-21) | The reference on the still incomplete theory of turbulence
      | [Kinzel: Physik per Computer](https://www.amazon.de/Physik-per-Computer-Programmierung-physikalischer/dp/3827400201) | Rare book on algorithms for Computational Physics including an introduction to neural nets
1990  | [Pauli: Die allgemeinen Prinzipien der Wellenmechanik](https://www.amazon.de/Die-allgemeinen-Prinzipien-Wellenmechanik-herausgegeben/dp/3540519491/?tag=maierandi-21) | Pauli's so called "New Testament" about wave mechanics
1988  | [Dirac: The Principles of Quantum Mechanics](https://www.amazon.de/Principles-Quantum-Mechanics-P-Dirac/dp/0198520115/?tag=maierandi-21) | The first chapter is worth a Nobel prize alone - It explains the need for quantum mechanics very clearly
